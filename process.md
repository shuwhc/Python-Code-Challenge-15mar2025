Since i had completed some leetcode question with the assist of Claude-3 before, and the Claudes were trained with leetcode solutions.
So i used the Claude-3.5 for assisting.
but before using the Claude, i will understand the question and constraint and search which algo to use for the "Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes"

https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-visiting-all-nodes/description/

So the flowchart on Algo Master and Cladue both use Breadth-first search for unweighted undirected connected graph.

The code that Claude provided pass all test cases on LeetCode. It also had clear comments to explain the logic behind it.
